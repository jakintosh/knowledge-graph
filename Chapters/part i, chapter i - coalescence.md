In order for the rest of this series of lenses to make an impact, we first need to talk about the concept of lenses themselves. The goal of this series is to give you tools to make sense of the world on your own, not to give you a map. Teaching you how to fish, instead of giving you a fish. To be blunt, teaching you how to think, instead of what to think. So, what exactly is a lens? Stated simply, a lens is “a way of looking at the world”. An optimist looks at the world through a positive lens, and a pessimist looks at the world through a negative lens. If you stop watching right now and take only one thing from this video it’s this: instead of defining people by their lenses like we just did with the optimist and pessimist—they were defined by their positive or negative lens—we can think of the lenses as their own objects, to be picked up, used, or discarded by anyone. You are separate from your lenses, and understanding this can have a profound impact on the way you perceive and engage with the world. Let’s get into it.

## perception shapes reality

### senses determine our personal physical realities
Our physical senses shape our personal understanding of the world. We can see, hear, taste, touch, and smell our environments, and our brain combines all of that information to create a picture of reality. However, we don’t all have the same sensory capabilities, and so that picture of reality created by our senses is unique to us. We don’t often run into issues where two people disagree on what is true about the physical world; our senses are redundant enough where if I claim there is a table in the middle of the room, but someone with impaired sight can’t see it, they can touch it and add it to their mental map of the room. However, what we do have is opportunities for information *loss*; if I tell that same person that the table is green, they can’t really disagree, but they also can’t confirm it. In this way, our physical senses are lenses for the physical world; they let us make sense of otherwise raw data. Our senses determine our personal model of reality, and everybody’s personal reality is unique to them.

### every perception shapes total reality
While we all have our own personal understandings of reality, it’s important to call out that those understandings are based on the same “actual” reality, or “objective” reality. Let’s go back to the table example. I said it was green, but let’s say I have colorblindness, and the table was actually red. In my personal construction of reality, the table is green. In objective reality though, the table is red. And to the visually impaired person, the table color is undefined. Now in this example, you can say “well, it doesn’t really matter what those two people’s visual lenses make them believe, the table *is* red”, and you’d be right, but very shortly our thought experiments will leave the cold, hard, realm of physics and enter the extremely subjective realm of social human thought. So let’s tackle this now: instead of talking about humans, lets abstract our subjects to “sensory agents”—any entity in the world with sensory capability. This could now include animals, plants, air conditioning systems, and scientific instruments like thermometers or thermal cameras. All of these sensory agents have their own sensory lenses, and their own individual realities constructed from those lenses. If we combined all of the individual realities from the sensory agents, we can create a conceptual “total perceived reality”. Now, if there is some data in the objective reality that none of the existing sensory agents in the universe can perceive, it won’t be a part of that “total perceived reality”. In this way, we can argue that if something can’t be perceived, it doesn’t really exist in our world of lenses and perception. If that bothers you, you may have a future in the fields of philosophy or theoretical physics. The real takeaway from this idea is pretty straightforward: as humans, we each have our own physical lens that lets us experience only a small slice of the world each day, based on where we are in the world and what we do. For example, lets look at a person who is at a coffee shop in Paris, and person who is trekking through the Sahara Desert at high noon; both are experiencing same planet earth at the same time, but through very different physical lenses.

### mental models shape our social reality
We can now see how physical senses shape each person’s “physical reality”. But what about the human world, the “social reality”? The color of a table is child’s play compared to the countless different ways that people perceive the social world. The values we should live by, the way we structure our society, the way we incentivize and punish behavior, the way we see love and relationships… each one of these few examples would take an unthinkable amount of time to fully detail all of the different ways each human personally understands these topics. But even though the human realm is more complicated than the physical one, the same concepts can transfer. Much like our physical senses shape our understanding of the physical world, the mental models we accumulate over the course of our lives shape our understanding of the social world. We pick up these mental models of the world from the places we grew up, the people and ideas we’ve encountered, the experiences we’ve had, and the decisions we’ve made. These mental models are the things mentioned above: the way we think about crime and punishment, how we define liberty, whether we prefer Coke or Pepsi.

## the lens of lenses

### humans see the world through lenses
Just like physical senses are our lenses into the physical world, our mental models are our lenses into the human world. We began this exploration with physical senses because it is a more intuitive way to start thinking about lenses, but from here on out, when we talk about lenses we mean the mental models in our brains that we use to process the world. To put it in simple terms, humans see the world through lenses. We can look at the world as a student, as a grandmother, as an economist, or as a doctor. Each of these lenses can look at the same world, and come to different understandings. What’s important to point out is that all of these different understandings are valid, even if they contradict. Going back to the physical analogy: two eyes looking at an object from different angles may see different images, but they are both valid interpretations of the world. Lenses go beyond simple “roles” like student or doctor, though; there are lenses for political schools of thought, like libertarian, socialist, or anarchist; there are lenses for philosophy, like modernist, materialist, or nihilist; your personal faith is a lens, your smartphone preference is a lens, whether you look at blockchain as revolutionary or as a scam is a lens. The point is that every “way” you can think about something is a lens. Every thought you have in your brain runs through a lens.

### our sense of self is a collection of lenses

### looking through the lens of lenses
(Word dump, not final) These mental models are our lenses into the social world, just like our eyes and ears are lenses into the physical one. However, unlike our physical lenses, there are no universally agreed upon “correct” way for these social lenses to work. An eye can more or less be judged to be working “correctly” or not, but a person’s lens for how to navigate their career has no wall chart to calibrate against. Our mental lenses also have the ability to profoundly impact the quality and direction of our life.

# Why We Start With “How”

outline:
- when we talk about what we want to happen, we need to argue about why that is what we need
- however, when we talk about why, we also need to explain how we are thinking

outline:
- when we collectively discuss the things we need to do to improve the world, by default we do so while looking at the world through a rigid and predetermined lens
- the analysis and proposals in the second half of this book were not reached by using the default lens provided by American society; I saw contradictions and gaps in that lens, and started by rethinking “how to look at the world in the first place”
- this first section is called “how to look at things”; it proposes an entirely new basis for interpreting the world based on observations of nature and the ways that human societies have ended up operating in practice

This book is the result of trying to understand the world from first principles. That means that instead of taking any existing information for granted or using the common perspectives to make sense of things, we will keep digging backwards and asking “why” until we get to the root of our questions. The basis of the argument laid out in this book is that the most fundamental ways that we think about the world are incomplete and flawed, and that before we can analyze the world and propose a path forward we must first spend some time thinking about *how* we are thinking. This is why we start with “how”. Instead of hacking through the jungle night and day to get to our destination, we should first take a step back and make sure that we are in the right 

In this first part of the book we will be discovering new tools for looking at the world, and then using those tools to build up that more complete understanding of the world.


## The Paradox of the Beginner
I assume that every person is familiar with that first stage of learning something new where you have the gut feeling of curiosity, but nothing else to go on. You type into the search field: “how to make bread”; “how do i bake a load of bread”; “how do you make bread”; “bread recipe”; “learning to bake bread”. Each search brings back a ton of information, but none of it really is giving you what you’re looking for. This stage is incredibly frustrating for the simple reason that at the beginning, *we don’t know what we don’t know*. This is “the paradox of the beginner”: we don’t know what questions to ask, because if we did we wouldn’t need to ask them. The best thing a beginner can do is ask someone with experience to “ask questions” from their perspective. The experienced baker might suggest that the beginner instead ask: “what is the purpose of kneading dough?”; “what are the basic techniques for kneading dough?”; “how does dough hydration affect the bread loaf?”; ”what are baker’s percentages?”. When the beginner is asking “how do I learn to bake bread?”, this is really what they mean: “what don’t I know about baking bread?”.

Just like learning how to bake bread happens in the process of baking many loaves, learning “how to learn something new” happens in the process of learning many new things. I’ve been lucky enough to have educational and career environments where I had room to learn many new things, to the point where I’ve built up the skill of learning itself; having experienced the paradox of the beginner enough times, I’ve been able to see it, understand it, and reason my way around it. Instead of searching “learn how to bake bread”, I go to Wikipedia and try to read about the basics of what baking is, get a high level understanding of the topic, and make my best guesses about what those questions that the experienced baker would suggest to me.

## {Section Heading}
In this book, we will ultimately get into discussing a roadmap for large fundamental changes in human society. In the general political discourse, most people jump right to this step: making declarations about what they think the world should look like. This really only serves to polarize because without any deeper discussion about the “why”, the only people who will agree… are those who already agree. If we want to make more persuasive arguments, we should preface our declarations with analysis: “I think we should do X, because of my analysis Y”. This is better, but

When thinking about human economies, a helpful lens is that they are collections of systems of production. Each system in the economy is a process of production, where source resources are converted into different resources. A very simple example is this system for producing corn:

`{ soil, seeds } => { corn }`

However, it's missing some pieces. Let's account for a deeper look at inputs, and also the byproducts:

`{ soil, seeds, water, sunlight } => { corn crop, consumed soil }`

Now we see passive inputs like water and sunlight, as well as side effects like the consumed soil. This is more complete, but with more detail brings new questions. Where does the soil input come from? How exactly does the soil get altered at the end? How does the corn crop yield edible corn? Let's break this down a little bit more:

1: `{ water, clay, silt, sand, organic matter, living organisms } => { soil }`
2: `{ soil, seeds, water, sunlight, farming knowledge, labor } => { corn crop, soil (minus water and nitrogen) }`
3: `{ corn crop, machinery, knowledge, labor } => { corn kernels, inedible biomass }`

With even more detail we can see sub-systems, like where the soil comes from in the first place, and how the corn crop is milled into smaller components. We can also see how the soil has been degraded, by losing nitrogen and water. Using the concept of the [[The Universal System|universal system]], we can continue [[System Expansion|expanding]] these systems almost endlessly: adding more detail to explain where inputs come from, and being more specific about "waste" products and side effects.

Given this example, two things become apparent: 1) seemingly [[Simple Systems|simple systems]] of production can quickly become [[Complex Systems|complex systems]] through [[System Expansion|expansion]], and 2) the detailed systems become a puzzle, where one systems outputs become another system's inputs. That second point has massive implications.

In a real world economy with a finite set of resources, there are only three possible states that the resources of that economic system can be in, regarding its input requirements: regenerating, maintaining, or degrading. If the total ouputs of all subsystems produce more inputs than necessary, the system is in a state of regeneration; this would be a [[Systems of Regeneration|regenerative economy]]. If the outputs equal exactly, it is maintaining (this is impossible in practice). If the outputs yield less resources than are needed for inputs, the system is in a state of degradation; this would be an [[Systems of Extraction|extractive economy]].

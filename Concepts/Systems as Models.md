When we describe a system in terms of inputs, processes, and outputs, it's important to understand that [[Communication and Models|the description is not the system itself]], but only a *model* of a system. This is a very important distinction because depending on what we are trying to understand, we can [[System Expansion|expand]] or contract any system’s model to cover only the most simple abstract concepts (like “true or false”), or to encompass all physical matter in the universe in complete detail (like modelling every subatomic particle interaction).

When we model systems, they are most useful to us when they are as abstract as they can be, without losing critical information: too abstract and the model does a bad job at predicting what will actually happen; too detailed and they become difficult to process and reason about.

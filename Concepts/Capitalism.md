Capitalism is an economic system based on the [[Private Property|private]] ownership of the [[Means of Production]] and their operation for profit. In simple terms, this means that individual people are allowed to privately own productive property, like a factory, and that they are allowed to make all decisions about that factory in the pursuit of making more money for themselves.

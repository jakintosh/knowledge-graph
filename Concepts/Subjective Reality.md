In very simple language, "subjective reality" means "reality from one person's perspective". The name comes from the fact that a "subject" (person) observes an "object" (the world), and we now have two sides of a story: the information according to the subject (subjective) and the information according to the object (objective). So "subejective reality" then refers to the "reality" as perceived by an observer.

Since a subjective reality depends requires an observer to exist, that means there are an unlimited number of unique subjective realities: one per observer.

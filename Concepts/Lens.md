A lens is a "way of looking at the world". Lenses are not a scientific method, but a tool for creatively observing the world and coming up with new ideas.

The term comes from a physical lens in a pair of glasses, where the wearer looks "through" the lens to see the world more clearly. However, in our context, we can also think of them as enabling other ways of seeing the world; in our glasses analogy, they could be filtering light like polarized sunglasses, or tinting colors for night time driving, or processing the light in a completly different way like night-vision goggles.

The most important thing to understand is that lenses are not "corrective"; there is no single correct way to look at the world. Just like all glasses are taking in the same light and modifying or filtering it before it gets to your eye, our philosophical lenses operate on the same information about the world but arrange it in different ways for us to understand it. Just like we might need to use several different glasses to get the full picture of visual information (like night-vision glasses in the dark), we need to use multiple philosophical lenses to get the fullest understanding of the situations we try to understand.

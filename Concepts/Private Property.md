When discussing or critiquing [[Capitalism]], the term "private property" refers to [[Means of Production]] that are privately owned. Private property does **not** refer to "personal property", which would be items like an individual person's house, clothes, cell phone, etc. The two terms are commonly (and incorrectly) assumed to be the same thing.

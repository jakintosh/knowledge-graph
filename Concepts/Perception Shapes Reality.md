The sensory filters that we use to perceive reality, shape reality. While an argument can be made for an “objective reality”, the physical state of the world *as it is*, in practice the world is only ever perceived by individual agents: people, animals, computers, even non-living systems like running water. Each of these systems has the ability to perceive the world through different senses, and each of these systems perceives the world differently based on those senses. For example, reality for a tiny insect with limited eyesight is much different than that of an adult human living in a large city, which is also much different than the reality for an HVAC system that has some temperature probes in a large warehouse. Each of those “agents” exists within the same “objective reality”, yet their individual subjective understanding of that same world is vastly different according to their perception. As humans, we must also take into account that our mental models of the world follow the same rules: someone who has a mental model of the world as a place of intense competition, violence, and zero sum game mechanics will perceive the same objective reality differently from someone who sees the world as a stage for collaboration, creativity, and abundance.

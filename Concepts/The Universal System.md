The entire universe can be understood as a single all encompassing [[Complex Systems|complex system]]. The inputs are every particle in the universe, the processes are all of the (known and unknown) laws of physics, and the output is a new state for every particle in the universe. Since the Universal System encompases every single thing and every single process, all possible systems that we can model are a subset of the universal system. This also means that any two systems, no matter how seemingly unrelated, can have their models connected in some way through the Universal System.

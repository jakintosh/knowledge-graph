This lens is the premise is that you can observe a system at different "scales" to make guesses about how the same or related systems might work at other scales.

An example: the "action potential" in a neuron requires the input signal to reach a certain threshold before it fires; we can use this observation to think about how the brain works at a higher level, perhaps that personal habits work in a similar way, requiring enough buildup of action potential before the habit “fires” and sticks with you long term. Of course, this doesn't prove anything—it merely gives us a creative way to create new ideas that we can test rigorously later.

This is a “lens”: a useful heuristic for intuiting information about a complex system. The premise is that you can observe a system at different scales to make hypotheses about the same or related systems at other scales. An example: action potential in a neuron requires the input to reach a certain threshold before it fires; we can use this observation to think about how the brain works at a higher level, perhaps that personal habits work in a similar way, requiring enough buildup of action potential before the habit “fires” and sticks with you long term. This is not a scientific method, but a tool for creative observation and hypothesis formation.

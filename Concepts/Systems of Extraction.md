Our current economic system is built for extraction. Our production process is almost completely based on locating natural resources (like oil, minerals, or timber), extracting them for use in production, and then finding new resources once a resource pool is empty. This type of extractive system has come into existence because of the shape of our dominant economic theory. Under neoclassical economics (supply and demand, market-centric, profit motive), the [[Perception Shapes Reality|perception that shapes reality]] is that short term gains have a higher priority than long term sustainability, and that non-financial costs are ignored as “externalities”. In practice, this means that from the viewpoint of the economic system itself, it cannot account for the long term implications of exhausting resources, and it cannot account for the ecological damage that it causes; those effects are “blind spots” caused by the theories themselves.

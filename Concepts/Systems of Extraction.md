In a system of extraction, the inputs needed for the [[Complex Systems|system]] to run are more than the outputs that the system produces. As an abstract example, we have this system:

`{object, object} => {object}`

This system is taking two input objects, but only produces one output object. Each cycle through this process cuts the number of objects in half, and eventually there wont be enough inputs for the system to continue running.

Real world examples are more complex, but follow the same basic rule. In the case of burning fossil fuels, we know for a fact that there are a finite amount of fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, coal) in the ground, and that burning them converts them into energy and non-usable waste (like greenhouse gasses). By looking at the system in this way we can see that burning fossil fuels for energy is an extractive system that will inevitably end; it is physically impossible for them to be used forever, since they are finite.

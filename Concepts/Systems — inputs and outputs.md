A [[Simple Systems|system]] can be thought about in many different ways, but the very simple definition that is built upon in this framework is: a process that takes an input and produces an output. There can be any number of inputs, any number of outputs, and any number of subprocesses, but thatâ€™s the core idea: input -> (process) -> output. Additionally, most systems run continuously, meaning that they will continue repeating the process until there is no input left, like a car engine that will continue combusting until the gasoline is gone. Going off of that, a [[Complex Systems|complex system]] is loosely defined here as a system with a large enough number of inputs, outputs, and subprocesses that it becomes difficult to determine how changing an input will change the output.

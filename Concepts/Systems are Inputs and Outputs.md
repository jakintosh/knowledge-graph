A [[Simple Systems|system]] can be thought about in many different ways, but the very simple definition that is built upon in this framework is: a process that takes an input and produces an output. There can be any number of inputs, any number of outputs, and any number of subprocesses, but thatâ€™s the core idea: input -> (process) -> output. The concept of something that consumes an input, runs a process, and yields an output only once can be referred to as a [[Function]]. Compared to this definition of a function, the key difference of a system is that systems run continuously, meaning that they will continue "repeating" the process until there is no input left, like a car engine that will continue combusting until the gasoline is gone.

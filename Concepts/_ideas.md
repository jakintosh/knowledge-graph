### [[Systems]]
- [[Systems are Inputs and Outputs]]
- [[Systems as Models]]
- [[Simple Systems]]
- [[The Universal System]]
- [[Complex Systems]]
- [[Systems of Extraction]]
- [[Systems of Regeneration]]
- [[Systems as Fractals]]
- “Upward Spiral” (systems of regeneration, over systems of extraction) (John Liu - ecosystem restoration camps)
- Mushrooms??? (example of cooperative support networks for life)
- Permaculture - organic farming over industrial -> holistic strategies vs. mechanistic view of life (Charles Eisenstein’s Climate book) - ​​spell of the sensuous (David Abram)
- “Lagging Indicators” (how different metrics of systems can have time lag behind other parts; building up a good buffer of resources can sustain a lot of resource drain, but once the resources are depleted and the negative consequences show through, it’s too late to do something about it)
- Socialism

### Narratives
- Hierarchy of life (cell->organ->organism->superorganism->global ecology)
- Individualism enables exploitation
- “Individualism as Cancer” -> 6th mass extinction event
- Collectivism, prioritizing the “whole”, more in line with nature
- Cooperation as natural process, as opposed to competition
- Coalescism -> the curse of language (how language can make it seem like we aren’t aligned when we are: falsified/false abstractions?) -raisondecalcul
- Larger narratives
- “Generalists” vs “Specialists” (generalists can make connections, specialists are used to alienate from things usually by capital) (‘renaissance man’, ‘trans-disciplinary’ = normal, the division of intellectual labor benefits capital, stops workers seeing relationships)
- Exploring Tribes vs Tribalism

### [[Knowledge]]
- [[Knowledge is Derivable]]
- [[Connections as Value]]
- Knowledge is inherently “free”
- The power of open knowledge
- Open source everything manifesto - robert david steele

### Economics
- Marx - historical and dialectical materialism
- (Global) Capitalism requires exploitation (Imperialism/decolonization)
- Capitalist economics ignores “true cost” (Externalities: oil is cheap because subsided by gov and military occupation; commodities are cheap because foriegn labor is exploited; profit drives the ignorance of true cost)
- The existing money system
- Cybernetics (Cybersyn) - the law of requisite variety + holochain (@CyberneticSere1)
- Valueflows & REA accounting, Mutual Credit (vs. fiat debt) - open value networks -> distributed fractal inter-organization economic networks (ERP -> NRP)
- Commons/Commonning

### Agent Centricity
- [[Perception Shapes Reality]]
- Holochain - arthur and eric (agent centric vs. data centric)
- Protocols in general
- Distributed Computing Architectures (maybe beyond just computers, the ideas of distributed systems as a whole)
- Agent-centric “thinking” -> pyramid (hierarchy) to circle (network)
- DAT, SSB and other DWeb allies/projects

### Movements and Action
- The movement only needs a few people (operating at the meta level, creating the tools and frameworks to enable the movement and actions)
- One Army/Precious Plastic - they have a recipe sharing tool - but not distributed?
- Open Source Ecology - movement-ing it?
- A worldwide Robin Hood/Aaron Swartz/decolonize day - build up to a mass open sourcing event/day - where workers ‘leak’/steal back all IP - (achive.org/EverywhereTech.org - Catarina Mota - reclaim IP)

### Uncategorized
- P2P distributed comparison/diff engine (reputation -> who discovers and produces ‘first’ can through getting credit take on more responsibility) -> leads to a cooperative single global diverse tree of knowledge (open protocols) (related to upload filter laws
- Attachment styles and how capitalism wrecks communities by gender norms and the nuclear family (Marx said: abolish the family!) + indigeous grief (Francis Weller) - indigeous knowledge. Ego: grandiosity + the collective unconscious/individual shadow. Gabor Mate - alienation
- Story of separation + story of interbeing (space between stories)
- Shared grammar for socialists to see and recognize the coalescism all around us? Or inversely: to show the absurd levels of false boundaries/duplicate concepts and ideas active (over-complexity?) in the capitalist knowledge system, + in the economy
- Cooperative democratic budgeting (capitalist nation states -> city/village states?)
- Continually (re)framing and (re)mapping collective challenges + using historical data to model predictions to be used to (re)organize and pre-organize?
- Holochain+Valueflows is a full toolkit - 
- Science and intellectual grandiosity -> artificial capitalist boundaries 
- A distributed Murmurations-like protocol - https://murmurations.network/ mapping+tracking+finding movements? Maybe can be seen as a sort of metanarrative choose-your-own-adventure type system/book that helps individuals rank various narratives for themselves/collectively? (joke -> of course 1) this story always wins https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6fcK_fRYaI, which is very similar to 2) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVJ9-aGnuRE, also just saw this quote: “He Who is your Lord, the All-Merciful, cherisheth in His heart the desire of beholding the entire human race as one soul and one body.” - BAHÁ’U’LLÁH)

##### Comments
- [[Jeremy]]: Who is the target audience? Why? What motivates those choices (there’s two of us) personally? What kind of vocabulary (complexity level/terminology - or how to avoid jargon)?

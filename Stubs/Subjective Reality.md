In very simple language, "subjective reality" means "reality from one person's perspective". The name comes from the fact that a "subject" (person) observes an "object" (the world), and we now have two sides of a story: the information according to the subject (subjective) and the information according to the object (objective).

Since subjective reality depends on an observer, that means there are an unlimited number of unique subjective realities: one per observer.

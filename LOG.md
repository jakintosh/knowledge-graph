Starting a log as a scratchpad to keep track of work.

Well, I didn't write anything last time. Anyway, I've been really struggling recently with organizing my thoughts. This (Obsidian) might be the best tool I have at the moment, but it still is way too rigid for me to get thoughts out quickly.

I need an easier way to dump concepts into a bin, and to then tag, filter, compose, and link them together. But at the same time, I cannot wait to start my "work" until after I've built a tool for doing that.

Starting to have a better way to organize this. Right now the idea is to have a Log (this file), Stubs, Concepts, Topics, and Artifacts. The Log tracks train of thought through time. Concepts are elements of knowledge that are used to compose Topics, which are "compound" ideas that propose some kind of understanding of the world. A Topic can then link to any number of Artifacts, which are manifestations of that Topic in some type of medium; a blog article, a twitter thread, a long form video, multiple short form videos. Stubs are unrefined precursors to any of these other types; when a raw idea pops up in my head, it goes into stubs. The intended workflow is to be able to write out stubs as they come to me, and then to always be shuffling those along to more thorough completion. The underlying concept graph should always be getting richer, and new topics should be easier to compose, and the resulting artifacts are easy to link back to see changes.

Been really playing around with this the last two days, getting a better feel for these pieces. Still don't feel like it's fully given me the freedom I'm looking for, but I'm really just eager to make any kind of sense of this at all. And I think either way, I can extract whatever I do here to some other system later on.

Got pulled away from this for a few days. Some of these things are starting to feel way too big, especially as I try to consolidate them into larger topics for a video or essay. I'm struggling to connect the bite-sized concepts into meaningful compound ideas. Perhaps I need a new approach... what if videos were presented as a collection of small concepts, with a "connecting the dots" section at the end? This would certainly make my life easier, and might also go further to show people how larger ideas are made of smaller ones. But would we lose a lot of connective tissue this way? It's unclear. Maybe later on once a lot of the groundwork is established, there can be looser topics that don't isolate components that build more of that connective tissue back up.

# Cooperative Coalescence: An Introduction

Cooperative Coalescence is a new cultural operating system for humans. Its purpose is to help humans more easily navigate *complexity*, and to create a stronger connection between what it means to be both an individual as well as a member of a larger social organism.

The core arguement of Cooperative Coalescence is that the foundational existential truths that the current dominant culture is built on are incomplete, and since they are foundational they are almost never questioned. This leads to cognitive dissonance in the individual, and an inability for the larger society to effectively make the changes it chooses for itself.

The foundational truths that I challenge are:
1. The "organism" (and specifically the "human organism") is the highest and final organization in the hierarchy of life
2. Change is created through a series of causes and effects
3. There is a single, shared, objective reality that we all occupy together

These three truths together provide the basis for a worldview in which: (1) an individual human can morally make decisions for only themselves; (2) using a short term cost/benefit analysis based on cause and effect; (3) within a sing shared reality of limited resources. This worldview is at the core of the current primary operating system, which is *Competitive Individualism*.

The alternative truths that underlie Cooperative Coalescence are:
1. The organism is just another layer in the holarchy of life; much like cells are individual living units that come together to form more complicated structures like plants and animals, organisms come together to create complex superorganisms like human societies, and those superorganisms come together to create ecological systems like forests and oceans, ultimately coalescing into the single living organism of the entire global ecology
2. Change is created by the feedback loops of countless different complex systems that are tightly interconnected, and circularly dependent
3. Human "reality" is subjective and perceived differently by each person

These expanded truths paint the picture of a different worldview, where (1) individuals are naturally part of a larger whole, (2) the interplay between many complex systems guide decision making and understanding, and (3) each person experiences a different version of the world. This is the foundation of Cooperative Coalescence; "cooperative" meaning "working together", and "coalescence" meaning "coming together".

Much like the concepts it is designed to deal with, the components of the Cooperative Coalescence operating system are highly interconnected and difficult to untangle. None of the components are new ideas, and the only thing I believe I can contribute is my perspective on how all of these pieces fit together. Instead of slowly teasing apart these pieces in private, I'll be doing so in public here on this site. The first few topics that I know are important are "Systems Thinking" and "Cognitive Psychology". These are the two topics that I'll start with, and as I go I'll build out the framework of connections that shape the operating system itself. The goal is to explore in depth all of the components, connect the pieces, and improve everything with feedback from others. In the end there will be a clear and concise package of self contained and easy to read material for anyone to pick up and understand what Cooperative Coalescence is about.

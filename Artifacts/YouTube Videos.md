# Overview
I need to have some kind of plan for the channel. I think there should be a "fundamentals" series of videos that introduce basic concepts (like lenses, systems, abstractions, and coalescence), and then perhaps other series of videos where it looks at those in more complex ways, to create new ideas from the components. So like, basic theory and then applied theory? Perhaps an "Understanding X" series for introductions, and then an "X: Applied" for other things? Maybe just a looser series that is "On Y" where Y is just some topic that is not a basic concept but where those topics are applied in many ways?

# Roadmap

- Lenses
- Systems

# Channel Brainstorm

## What is the point of this channel?
This channel is dedicated to the definition, exploration, and application of Cooperative Coalescence, which is a philosophical framework for a new unified human society. It is open for anyone willing to listen, but best suited to those who have a feeling in their gut that the way things are right now are not quite right. As part of our work here we'll be challenging some fundamental assumptions about our current society, and will do our best to point out where our egos may be blinding us, and propose strategies on how to deal with that.

- the topic is cooperative coalescence, a new framework for society
- we will reason from first principles about new ways to understand the world
- we will keep in mind how our psychology may prevent us from accepting these new ideas, and work around that
- we will use this framework to analyze and critique our current system
- we will use this framework to reason about what a new system should look like
- there are many entry points to engaging with these ideas, but some people might not be cut out for them right away. the people who will be most capable of digging in are those who already have a feeling in their gut that the way the world is currently structured isn't quite right.

## What is the tone of this channel?
God, I don't know. I shouldn't try to force myself into some kind of voice that isn't mine. But sometimes I feel like my voice isn't very well defined, and doesn't meet the requirements of this job. But what am I? Sincere, sometimes dramatic, reverent, introspective, meandering... I think if I took the right aspects of my natural tendencies I could create a voice that is impactful, but still authentic. Reduce the wandering and attempt to simplify thoughts, while still retaining some of the metacontext that I think my words might form. Perhaps a better way to put it is: reduce the filler. Get better at identifying the parts of sentences that are just verbal filler and the parts that are useful metacontext.

## What determines success of this channel?
Ultimately, this channel wants to give you a new operating system for your brain. I want to give you new tools for thinking about and understanding the world and your place in it, and I want you to make your own decision about if you want to install that new operating system. If this channel is successful, what will happen is this: a first draft of this operating system will be explained over the course of several introductory videos; from there, a small group of early adopters will resonate with them, and we'll continue to develop these ideas together by collectively refining the operating system. Then we'll make more videos where we apply the framework to critique the world as it is now, and dream up new ways it can be tomorrow. We'll keep  iterating and tweaking it until we get it right, at which point it will naturally begin to spread rapidly. Each person that chooses to adopt this new operating system will not only give more power to the new system, but also take away power from the old. At a certain point, enough of the people will have left the old system that it can no longer hold up its own weight, and will start to rapidly deflate; around the same time, the new one will reach a critical mass of utility and begin to grow even more rapidly. If we are thoughtful and swift, this transition can get underway before the material conditions of our current society completely collapse, and we can build up robust and scalable alternatives.

# Channel Brief
This channel is a project to bring about the next wave of consciousness and human potential, to connect everything to everything else, through a philosophical framework called Cooperative Coalescence. On this channel, we'll define and explore the key concepts of this framework, while also identifying psychological roadblocks that may prevent us from understanding them. Once we have a well reasoned baseline, we will use the framework to critique the existing dominant philosophical framework, which is Competitive Individualism. Finally, only after we have thoroughly defined and justified this new framework of Cooperative Coalescence, we will use it to draw blueprints for a new society, consisting of new social contracts, new economic models, and new forms of governance.

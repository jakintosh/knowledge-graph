# Overview
I need to have some kind of plan for the channel. I think there should be a "fundamentals" series of videos that introduce basic concepts (like lenses, systems, abstractions, and coalescence), and then perhaps other series of videos where it looks at those in more complex ways, to create new ideas from the components. So like, basic theory and then applied theory? Perhaps an "Understanding X" series for introductions, and then an "X: Applied" for other things? Maybe just a looser series that is "On Y" where Y is just some topic that is not a basic concept but where those topics are applied in many ways?

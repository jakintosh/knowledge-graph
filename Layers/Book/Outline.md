## thesis
human society has gone through a tremendous upheaval in the last hundred years due to economic globalization and the proliferation of low latency multimedia communications technologies. suddenly everything is connected to everything else in complex systems, and the ways we interpret things as individuals has not had the time to catch up to the new way the world works.

overall intended journey:
- set the stage
	- open the reader’s mind…
		- to thinking in new ways
		- to being okay with being wrong
		- to see past their ego
	- see the value in going “to the root of things”
	- give the reader a handful of new thinking tools
		- lenses
		- systems
		- abstractions
	- use those tools to discover new frameworks
		- coalescence
		- the social super organism
		- shifting
- use new frameworks to look at the state of the world
- propose new ways of approaching things

main points:

concepts
- we are all seeing the same world through different lenses
- everything is one big complex system
- we must build intuition around these tools
- differences are good, build resilience, and creates coalescence
- human society can be viewed as a single superorganism
- competitive individualism is literally cancer
- derivatives, feedback loops, and the layers of ”shifting”: making change
- perhaps examples of ecosystems in nature?

analysis
- coalescent analysis of economy
- coalescent analysis of politics and civics

proposals
- proposal for a new arrangement of labor and resources
- proposal for peer to peer systems of coordination
- proposal for transitioning ownership to stewardship

## Concepts

## Topics
- Socialism (not sure why this is here lol?)

# Narratives
New ways to look at the world from a story-telling perspective. How can we synthesize many concepts into cohesive stories about the world?

## Concepts

## Topics
- Individualism as Cancer
- Individualism enables Exploitation
- Cooperation as natural process, as opposed to competition
- “Generalists” vs “Specialists” (generalists can make connections, specialists are used to alienate from things usually by capital) (‘renaissance man’, ‘trans-disciplinary’ = normal, the division of intellectual labor benefits capital, stops workers seeing relationships)
- Exploring Tribes vs Tribalism

1. Present a Succinct, Holistic Critique of “The World as it Is”
	- Individualism enables exploitation (individual performance?)
	- Capitalism is bad - 1) profit motive - 2) black boxing of science and tech
	- Other good ideas
	- Seeing nature - highest leverage points? (also = the most power distortion) why has the working class missed seeing them? - ELI5


2. Paint Illustrations of “The World that Could Be”
	- Distributed power
	- Holistic lifestyles
	- Free knowledge - universal basic inheritance (access to the knowledge commons for all children)


3. Explain the power of Coalescence as a means for Unity
	- Seeing political/philosophical ideas as “lenses” on the same truth
	- Always seeking points of common interest, and following paths “up” to like-minded organizations

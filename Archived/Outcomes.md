#### Fears/worst case scenarios:

More than climate change I am scared of Bill Gates and others selling geo-engineering solutions to governments that absolutely wreck our biosphere. That and nuclear energy. Seriously, we wouldn’t need nuclear if we didn’t waste immense amounts of energy on today’s integrated (non-modular) black box tech. Or if we didn’t have to move for jobs due to the owners of IP deciding where certain knowledge work can and cannot be done (which controls how cities are built and what its like to live in them)

#### Hopes/best case scenarios:

Focused, impactful education crowdsourced to be approachable from many different angles can rapidly increase deep awareness of these problems among the people. Providing pathways to action along with tools for living out these new economies and lifestyles can create a rapid deflation of the old system, perhaps with minimal violence. A rapid transition to an equitable, just, ecologically balanced structure for society is possible with the right leverage points.

We are individual branches off of a primary, singular, universal consciousness — little feelers of the universe tasked with making sense of “what is”. Our sense of “self” is just a filter on that universal consciousness, evolved to make us capable of processing our environment in small chunks of time and space.

Humanity exists as a general purpose natural machine, evidenced directly by our discovery of additional general purpose machines like mathematics or computers. We are capable of anything, in a way that other natural machines are not.

This distributed sense of selves allows Humanity to develop billions of novel thought patterns, each thought capable of isolated development through each self, and then combination through communication. The distributed selves allow for vast heterogeneity in problem solving.

But, it is important for us to be able to understand our link back to the universe at large. We are not actually individuals, but a single node in one universal system that has the ability to perceive separate “selves”, much like a thread on a computer.

# Intent
The intent of this topic is to lay a groundwork of understanding for "subjective reality", to help the reader start to think of the world in terms of lenses, and perhaps begin to see the world at a higher layer of abstraction than they are used to.

# Relevant Concepts
![[Subjective Reality]]
![[Objective Reality]]

# Outline
- Physical senses shape subjective reality
	- Physcial senses allow us to perceive the world
	- They accumulate and filter raw data of the physcial world
	- We each have our own set of sensory abilities, and our own unique subjective reality

# Intro: Defining "Subjective" and "Objective" Reality
Before we begin, I think it will be helpful to quickly and clearly define these terms to make sure we are on the same page. In very simple language, "subjective reality" means "reality from one person's perspective". Likewise, simply, "objective reality" means "the true reality". The names of these terms come from the fact that a "subject" (person) observes an "object" (the world), and we now have two sides of a story: the information according to the subject (subjective) and the information according to the object (objective).

There's a lot more nuance to it than these simplifications, but there are only two other main things to know. First: the objective reality being "true" doesn't necessarily mean that subjective realities are "false"; they are both real. Second, and finally: since subjective reality depends on the observer (people, generally) and the objective reality depends on the thing being observed (the physical universe, generally), that means there are many unique subjective realities (one per observer), but only one objective reality.

# Physical senses shape our subjective realities
Our physical senses shape our personal understanding of the world. We can see, hear, taste, touch, and smell our environments, and our brain combines all of that information to create an understanding of reality. However, we don’t all have the same sensory capabilities and we don't all occupy the same environment, and so that picture of reality created by our senses is unique to each person.

We don’t often run into issues where two people disagree on what is true about the physical world; our senses are redundant enough where if I claim there is a table in the middle of the room, but someone with impaired sight can’t see it, they can touch it and add it to their mental map of the room. However, what we do have is opportunities for information *loss*; if I tell that same person that the table is green, they can’t really disagree, but they also can’t confirm it. In this way, our physical senses are lenses for the physical world; they let us make sense of otherwise raw data. Our senses determine our personal subjective reality, and everybody’s personal subjective reality is unique to them.

# Objective reality is constant
While we all have our own personal understandings of reality, it’s important to call out that those understandings are based on the same “actual” reality, or “objective” reality. Let’s go back to the table example. I said it was green, but let’s say I'm colorblind and the table was actually red. In my personal construction of reality, the table **is** green. In objective reality though, the table is red. And to a completely visually impaired person, the color of the table is undefined.

The real takeaway from this idea is pretty straightforward: as humans, we each have our own physical lens that lets us experience only a small slice of the world each day, based on where we are in the world and what we do. As another example, lets look at a person who is at a coffee shop in Paris, and person who is trekking through the Sahara Desert at high noon; both are experiencing same planet earth at the same time, but through very different physical lenses.


Now in this example, you can say “well, it doesn’t really matter what those two visually impared people’s visual lenses make them believe, the table *is* red”, and you’d be right, but soon our thought experiments will leave the objective realm of physics and enter the extremely subjective realm of social human thought, so let’s tackle this now: instead of just talking about humans perceiving reality, lets abstract our subjects to “sensory agents”—any entity in the world with sensory capability. This could now include animals, plants, air conditioning systems, and scientific instruments like thermometers or thermal cameras. All of these sensory agents have their own sensory lenses, and their own subjective realities constructed from those lenses. If we combined all of the individual subjective realities from every sensory agent, we can create a conceptual “total perceived reality”. Now, if there is some data in the objective reality that none of the existing sensory agents in the universe can perceive, it won’t be a part of that “total perceived reality”. In this way, we can argue that if something can’t be perceived, it doesn’t really exist in our world of lenses and perception. (If that bothers you, perhaps you might have a future in the fields of philosophy or theoretical physics.)

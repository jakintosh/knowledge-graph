# Intent
The intent of this topic is to give the reader enough of an introduction to the concept of lenses that they can start to see their own thinking as a set of lenses.

# Relevant Concepts
![[Perception Shapes Reality]]
![[Lens]]
![[Subjective Reality]]

# Brainstorm
I want to explain to people how to see their own thinking as a set of lenses. This foundation will ultimately be used to explain coalescence, as well as some philosophical points on the nature of the self, and an understanding of subjective reality. in order to make those future ideas easier to grasp, this idea needs to plant some seeds, which are:
1) each person has their own “perspective” which can be thought of as a lens, or set of lenses
2) you can, with practice and focus, look through other people’s lenses and take them for yourself
3) you can analyze your existing lenses and polish or discard ones you don’t find useful anymore
Is there anything that we need to explain up front before talking about this? Prerequisites? I don't think so.

## Outline
- Intro
	- the world has become very complex very quickly, and most people don't have access to the thinking tools they need to deal with that complexity
	- this video is the first in a series where we'll walk through some concepts to help you process information better
	- this video is on the topic of "Lenses", which are "ways of looking at the world"
- [[Subjective Reality]] and [[Objective Reality]]
	- subjective is from perspective of perceiver
	- objective is from perspective of perceived
- Senses "create" our physical reality
	- we each have at most five senses that we use to perceive the physical world
	- there is a single "objective" physical reality that we look at with multiple sense, easy to find agreement
	- our senses create our physical sense of self as an entity in the world
- **[[Lens|Lenses]]** "create" our non-physical reality
	- each piece of information we hold and each experience we have is a lens
	- we each have hundreds or thousands of lenses to look at the non-physical world
	- there is not an objective non-physical reality; it only exists in the realm of subjectivity, making disagreement very easy and common
	- those lenses collectively form our personal perspective on the world, and create our sense of self as a thinking being {roughly the difference between the body (physical/senses) and the mind (non-physical/lenses)}
- The Lens of "Lenses"
	- you can use this concept of lenses as a lens itself
	- you can analyze your existing lenses, and discard ones you don’t find useful anymore
	- you can, with practice and focus, look through other people’s lenses and take them for yourself
- Implications
	- understanding that lenses exist gives us a powerful new layer for communication. the point of communicating is to move ideas between brains, and without thinking about lenses we miss out on the encoding/decoding part. if you have a mismatch between encoders and decoders, there could be unintentional conflict and disagreement.
	- humans will try to use familiar metaphors to make sense of things; we try to use the metaphor of the physical world having a true solid basis in the realm of subjectivity, and that leads us to trouble
	- when we engage with the world with the knowledge of lenses, it becomes easier to see how disgreements are usually coming from the fact that different groups are looking at something through different lenses, but without knowing that they need to discuss the lenses first

## Visualizations
1) Example of Objective and Subjective perspectives
2) Viewing an object from multiple perspectives
3) Our body as a physical entity in the objective world
4) Lenses forming from individual experiences and information

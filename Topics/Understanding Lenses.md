# Intent
The intent of this topic is to give the reader enough of an introduction to the concept of lenses that they can start to see their own thinking as a set of lenses.

# Relevant Concepts
![[Perception Shapes Reality]]
![[Lens]]
![[Subjective Reality]]

# Brainstorm
I want to explain to people how to see their own thinking as a set of lenses. This foundation will ultimately be used to explain coalescence, as well as some philosophical points on the nature of the self, and an understanding of subjective reality. in order to make those future ideas easier to grasp, this idea needs to plant some seeds, which are:
1) each person has their own “perspective” which can be thought of as a lens, or set of lenses
2) you can, with practice and focus, look through other people’s lenses and take them for yourself
3) you can analyze your existing lenses and polish or discard ones you don’t find useful anymore
Is there anything that we need to explain up front before talking about this? Prerequisites? I don't think so.

## Outline
- Intro
	- the world has become very complex very quickly, and most people don't have access to the thinking tools they need to deal with that complexity
	- this video is the first in a series where we'll walk through some concepts to help you process information better
	- this video is on the topic of "Lenses", which are "ways of looking at the world"
- [[Subjective Reality]] and [[Objective Reality]]
	- subjective is from perspective of perceiver
	- objective is from perspective of perceived
- Senses "create" our physical reality
	- we each have at most five senses that we use to perceive the physical world
	- there is a single "objective" physical reality that we look at with multiple sense, easy to find agreement
	- our senses create our physical sense of self as an entity in the world
- **[[Lens|Lenses]]** "create" our non-physical reality
	- each piece of information we hold and each experience we have is a lens
	- we each have hundreds or thousands of lenses to look at the non-physical world
	- there is not an objective non-physical reality; it only exists in the realm of subjectivity, making disagreement very easy and common
	- those lenses collectively form our personal perspective on the world, and create our sense of self as a thinking being {roughly the difference between the body (physical/senses) and the mind (non-physical/lenses)}
- The Lens of "Lenses"
	- you can use this concept of lenses as a lens itself
	- you can analyze your existing lenses, and discard ones you don’t find useful anymore
	- you can, with practice and focus, look through other people’s lenses and take them for yourself
- Implications
	- understanding that lenses exist gives us a powerful new layer for communication. the point of communicating is to move ideas between brains, and without thinking about lenses we miss out on the encoding/decoding part. if you have a mismatch between encoders and decoders, there could be unintentional conflict and disagreement.
	- humans will try to use familiar metaphors to make sense of things; we try to use the metaphor of the physical world having a true solid basis in the realm of subjectivity, and that leads us to trouble
	- when we engage with the world with the knowledge of lenses, it becomes easier to see how disgreements are usually coming from the fact that different groups are looking at something through different lenses, but without knowing that they need to discuss the lenses first

## Visualizations
1) Example of Objective and Subjective perspectives
2) Viewing an object from multiple perspectives
3) Our body as a physical entity in the objective world
4) Lenses forming from individual experiences and information

#### The Context of the World
If you've been paying attention, you may have noticed that the world is a mess. Many systems we rely on to live are collapsing, from the climate and food systems, to our civic governments and supply chains. There's a lot of people on YouTube doing a great job of explaining the political, historical, and economic reasons for this mess, and they are doing important and necessary work. But I'd like to look at our mess from a different angle. My argument is this: due to the unimagineable amount of new information and connections that have been generated by the internet, the world has gotten a lot more complicated in the last 25 years, and most humans do not yet have the proper thinking tools to be able to process all of that complexity. This is not because our brains aren't capable of understanding complexity, but because the default thinking patterns that we learn, our "Cultural Operating System", isn't built for it. I argue that our inability to process this complexity causes paralysis, confusion, and communication breakdown due to information overload. It magnifies all of the other structural problems we are facing, and cripples our ability to take the actions we need to take to build the future. So, in order to actually bring about the change the world needs, we need to first take a step back and rewire our brains.

> “Keep on as you have begun, and make all possible haste, so that you may have longer enjoyment of an improved mind, one that is at peace with itself. Doubtless you will derive enjoyment during the time when you are improving your mind and setting it at peace with itself; but quite different is the pleasure which comes from contemplation when one’s mind is so cleansed from every stain that it shines.” —Seneca

This channel is about "Cooperative Coalescence", which is what I propose as our next Cultural Operating System. It stands in opposition to the existing COS, which is "Competitive Individualism". We'll be exploring some of the philosophical foundations of our current society, and reexamining some of the ideas that we assume are correct, that we've built everything else on top of. We'll be doing our best to use something called "first principles thinking"[good link](https://fs.blog/first-principles/), where we break down an idea until we can't break it down anymore, and then put the peices back together in the way that makes the most sense instead of just the way it was before. We'll eventually bring these ideas back around to political and economic critique, but only after we've established a set of new truths to operate on.

This channel serves as the beginning of bringing my ideas out into the world. I believe that the value of knowledge comes from its connections, and so while without a doubt everything that I will say here has been said before, I hope that you find some value in the way that I've connected these ideas together, and contribute your own perspective back into the project, so that it may grow to encompass a more complete understanding of the world.

### What is this Series?
This video is the first in a series on the fundamental concepts for a new cultural operating system that I refer to as "Cooperative Coalescence". The goal is to give you tools that help you intuitively navigate complexity, and help you avoid the paralysis that comes from information overload. If our generation is going to solve the climate crisis, de-escalate the culture war, and organize into a more resiliant and just civilization, we must first get our collective wits together.

### What is this Video?
This video is on the topic of "Lenses", which are "ways of seeing the world". In my opinion, this is the foundational concept that enables everything else we'll talk about on this channel. In fact, most of what we'll be talking about will be ideas that are lenses, and I think of this topic the "lens of lenses". Lets get into it.

## The Two Types of Reality
If we're going to develop an entirely new cultural operating system, lets make sure we're not making any assumptions by starting all the way at the beginning and asking: what is reality? This isn't a joke: it's at this level where this new operating system immediately diverges from our existing one.

The two types of reality are called "Objective Reality" and "Subjective Reality". The names come from the fact that a "subject" observes an "object", and we now have two sides of the story: the object as it was perceived by the subject (subjective) and the object according to the object itself (objective). In simpler terms, subjective is "the way something is perceived", and objective is "the way something is".

The type of reality that most of us understand is "Objective Reality". The physical world that we all move through every day is understood to be something that is the same for everyone. We believe it has truth to it; for example, if a tree falls in the woods and nobody was around to hear it, it still makes a sound. Regardless of who is perceiving it (or not), the world is the same, and there is only one. That is objective reality.

However, in practice, none of us ever actually encounter this objective reality. We have physical senses that interpret light waves from our eyes, sound waves from our ears, vibrations from other physical matter from nerves throughout our body, and chemical receptors for taste and smell that all come together in our brain and create a feeling of physcial presence. But everything that we see, hear, taste, touch, and smell is filtered and processed into something that lets us experience a smooth and flowing sensory existance. For example, other animals have different sensory capabilities than we do; they see more wavelengths of light, or hear more frequencies of sound. What any living organism experiences is only a subset of the objective reality that may exist. **Each of us only ever experiences our own personal subjective understanding of reality.** We only know "objects as we perceive them", not the objects themselves.

When it comes to the physical world, though, there seems to be an actual, tangible, concrete, shared world that we are all perceiving together. So in most cases, even though we are individually experiencing a subjective interpretation of that world, our experiences match up. We can all see the same videos on youtube, and even if our individual perceptions are a little off, our experience is based off of the exact same pixels and sound waves. So, because there is generally a very high level of agreement between our subjective experiences of the objective world, in our current operating system we tend to just hand wave it and say "there is only the objective reality". It's simpler that way, and for the most part, in the physical world, this is fine. But where it falls apart is when we leave the cold hard physical world, and enter the complex realm of human thought.

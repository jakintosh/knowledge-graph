# Intent
This is probably just a dumping ground for lots of random thoughts about capitalism.

# Relevant Concepts
![[Capitalism]]

# Notes
The key assumptions of capitalism is that everything must be owned by someone, that the owner of each thing has no enforcable responsibilities towards others,

Alternatives to this arrangement include giving decision making power and ownership over the [[Means of Production]] to the workers who perform the labor, and in other cases placing all productive property into collective stewardship among everyone within a society instead of only the workers. 

The major side effects of this simple foundational rule are:
1) A capitalist economy ends up requiring that everything must have an owner
2) Competition is necessary and good

The capitalist economic system is built for extraction. Its production processes are almost completely based on locating natural resources (like oil, minerals, or timber), extracting them for use in production, and then finding new resources once a resource pool is empty.

This type of extractive system has come into existence because of the shape of our dominant economic theory. Under [[Neoclassical Economics]] (supply and demand, market-centric, profit motive), the [[Perception Shapes Reality|perception that shapes reality]] is that short term gains have a higher priority than long term sustainability, and that non-financial costs are ignored as “[[Externalities]]”.

In practice, this means that from the viewpoint of the economic system itself, it cannot account for the long term implications of exhausting resources, and it cannot account for the ecological damage that it causes; those effects are “blind spots” caused by the theories themselves.
